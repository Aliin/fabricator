# Contributing to this project

This project is intended to collaborate on, learn, and help each other. We are happy for anyone who likes to join us. We aim to make it very beginner friendly so you can join at any skill level.

## Joining as a beginner

We try to make setting up the project as simple as possible but that is always a challenge to anyone, especially a beginner - so ask for help if you are stuck!

Expect to ask a lot of questions and be active if you want to learn something. We will happily answer as much as we can manage, but also try to find your own answers and have and own your own opinions.

It is important especially as a beginner not to be passive but to look at the project, try to understand things, and suggesting / creating your own features.

We encourage you to also do code reviews of other people's code to learn, give feedback, ask questions, criticize constructively and get involved. Never be intimidated.

## Collaboration

It's really easiest just to contact the project owner at jhodge@outlook.de to set you up as a collaborator. There are no requirements.

## If you're not a collaborator or not yet

The same rules go for you as for collaborators, but you are not allowed to merge anything onto master yourself, and code reviews will generally be done by collaborators except if you ask to do some.

Instead of creating branches please fork the project, create a branch directly mirroring and referencing an issue and then create a pull request onto the original repository.

## Working on branches

Our work always pertains to an issue. As such, you may work on any issue that is not either already assigned or claimed in a comment, except for issues labelled 'meta' or 'assigned' or somehow marked as closed for assignment. You are encouraged to also split issues into smaller issues if that's possible and works well and work on one of them.

You SHALL assign yourself to an issue if you want to work on it. If that's not possible for some reason, make it clear in a comment that you're working on it.

You SHALL leave a comment EVERY WEEK BEFORE SATURDAY whether you are continuing to work on the issue in the next week. You may also keep the issue assigned if you're not available for a while and tell us first, depending on whether it's urgent or there are any reasons against it.

Inactive issues WILL be reassigned every weekend. If there is an issue with someone assigned to it that HAS BEEN inactive for a whole week and the assignee has neither worked on it nor given information if he or she is still active the issue will become unassigned and someone else can take it.

A new assignee on an issue that already had someone work on it should check whether there is a related branch or discussion and then either continue work on the branch or if they prefer start from scratch.

We assume that it's fine for you if someone else continues with the branch you worked on unless you tell us otherwise.

Every issue SHALL have exactly one feature branch unless there's a good reason to have more.

You SHALL reference the issue in your commit messages via "#issue-number", e.g. "#12" without the quotes.
